## Introduction:

If you're thinking about transitioning your cat to a raw food diet, you may be wondering how to do it. In this article, we'll share our experience transitioning our cat, Luna, to barf. We'll cover everything from the benefits of a raw food diet to the specific steps we took to make the transition smooth.

## Benefits of a Raw Food Diet for Cats:

There are many benefits to feeding your cat a raw food diet. Some of the most notable benefits include:

- Improved gut health: A raw food diet can help to improve your cat's gut health by providing them with the enzymes and probiotics they need to digest food properly.
- Reduced allergies and skin problems: A raw food diet can help to reduce allergies and skin problems in cats by eliminating processed foods and other allergens from their diet.
- Increased energy levels: A raw food diet can help to increase your cat's energy levels by providing them with the nutrients they need to stay active.
- Longer lifespan: Studies have shown that cats who eat a raw food diet tend to live longer than cats who eat a processed food diet.

## Our Experience Transitioning Luna to Barf:

We adopted Luna when she was 10 months old. She was a stray who had been found in the gutter. We decided to transition her to a raw food diet in order to improve her health.

We did extensive research on raw food diets for cats. We found that there are a few different ways to prepare raw food, so we went for a method that worked for us.

How We Made the Transition Smooth:

We started by giving a small amount of raw food to Luna. We did this for a few days, gradually increasing the amount of raw food and decreasing the amount of regular food. We also made sure to give her the right proportions of parts, so that she would get all the nutrients she needed.

## The Challenges We Faced:

One of the challenges we faced was that Luna didn't seem to enjoy vegetables very much. We started by mixing them up with the meat but we eventually decided to separate the vegetables from the meat and organs and let her choose what she would eat.

Another challenge we faced was that Luna was still hungry all the time. We realised that it can take up to 18 months for a cat to reach adulthood, and that kittens need to eat more food than adult cats. We increased the amount of food we were giving Luna, and she started to feel more satiated.

## The Results:

We're really happy with how the transition went for Luna. Her hair is really shiny, she is lean and her poop doesn't smell. She has a lot of energy and loves to play. We're continuously trying to improve the way we feed her barf, since the research always finds new insights. This way we are sure that we are giving her the best menu possible :)

# Conclusion:

Transitioning your cat to a raw food diet can be a great way to improve their health and well-being. By doing some research, you can make the transition smooth and easy for your cat.
